All you need is in the dist folder
This program take a .txt file with the list of items
Enter in or replace the item list in file inventory (txt file)
Then double click the inventory_counter.exe program and a window will appear
And then the output will be given in a newly created inventory_output csv file
This file can be imported or opened in Excel or Google Sheets or another Spreadsheet software

Extra files are the old program used to create the dist file
Still runnable but is executed differently and bloats the program
